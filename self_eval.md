# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

A: Conditionals are useful when you need to differentiate between something: two variables, two states, etc.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

A: I would have checked ahead of time to better estimate the completion time, instead of assuming the completion time would match the other exercises! (My organizational skills are definitely in need of improvement)

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

A: Today I was very lucky to have all of my code resolve "correctly" on the first attempt. That almost never happens, so it was a nice feeling. 

(Of course, there's nothing wrong with not nailing the first coding attempt - and if anything, you probably learn the most in those instances. But still, I take Ws where I can get them.)
